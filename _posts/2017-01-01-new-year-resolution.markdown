A new year and the old me. Here an overview of my plans of this year and beyond.

The plan of this year is to get a lot of stuff done (as completing it). This include finishing my study in Nuclear fusion physics, which should be straight forwars from now one. Get a significant portion of the LEGO CableTrack project done both in the real world as digitally. 

This year I want to publish multible blog posts about some running projects of mine, this is partily for myself to get those projects organised but also to make a place to showcase these projects as they might be interresting for others. 

Some of the projects I want to write about are: The LEGO CableTrack, NeutronCode and The TU/e FUSOR software. Next to this I want to express my thoughs about little projects which will be listed some other time.
