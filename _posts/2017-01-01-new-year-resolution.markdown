Most of this post is written on the first of january, to start a project to give an overview of projects I'm working on:

A new year and the old me. Lots is the same but now I fill the internet with it. Here an overview of my plans of this year and beyond.

The plan of this year is to get a lot of stuff (as in projects) done (as in completing them). This include finishing my study in Nuclear fusion physics, which should be straight forwars from now one. Get a significant portion of the LEGO CableTrack project done both in the real world as digitally. 

This year I want to publish multible blog posts about some running projects of mine, this is partily for myself to get those projects organised but also to make a place to showcase these projects as they might be interresting for others. 

Some of the projects I want to write about are: The LEGO CableTrack, NeutronCode and The TU/e FUSOR software. Next to this I want to express my thoughs about little projects which will be listed some other time. 

Now just a braindump of projects I have though about (not in anyway complete and in order):

- House furnasing (lamps, light-wall, desk with computer) 
- LEGO cabinet, 
- LEGO tripod robot
- (LEGO) droitica (physical possible version) 
- Robot snake
- Home automation
- NAS backup and recovery
- PC+Laptop+mobile syncronisation, 
- LEGO GBC,
- ThÃªta roeibak,
- Puzzle program/robot, 
- Computer cluster (from old hardware), 
- RC boot (completing build and automation), 
- LEGO mammoet module, 
- This site, 
- Dedicated site for the LEGO CableTrack.
