Muhaha, finally I got place on the internet to spam my spam and showcase what I'm up to. 

A short overview of my plans of this site, I want to show the projects that I work(ed) on. 
These include a code that can calculate the neutron production rate of electrostatic confinement device. 


{% highlight c %}
int main(void)
{
    printf("hello worlds!\n");

    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
